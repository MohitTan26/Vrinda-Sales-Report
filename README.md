# Vrinda-Sales-Report
The project titled 'Vrinda Store Report 2022' aimed to help the store create an annual sales report, analyze customer behavior and boost customer sales.
I performed various tasks such as data cleaning, processing, analysis, visualization and report creation.

## The project also answered important questions such as: 
- How do sales and orders compare using a single chart?
- Which month had the highest sales and orders?
- Who purchased more, men or women in 2022?
- What are different order statuses in 2022?
- Which are the top 5 states contributing to sales?
- What is the relation between age and gender based on the number of orders?

## Insights
* Women are more likely to buy compared to men (~65%).
* Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh are Top 3 states(~35%)
* Max contributiion of approximately 35% is made by adult age group between 30-49 yrs.
* Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra channels are max contributing (~80%).

## Final Conlusion to improve Vrinda Store Sales:
